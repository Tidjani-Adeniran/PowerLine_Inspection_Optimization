# PowerLine_Inspection_Optimization
This project uses Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to plan efficient UAV paths for inspecting power line corridors. It aims to minimize flight distance, avoid obstacles, and ensure full coverage. ACO simulates ant behavior to find optimal routes, improving safety, speed, and cost-effectiveness of inspections.
Hierarchical Ant Colony Optimization for Multi-Agent Powerline Inspection
Project Overview
This project presents a novel Hierarchical Ant Colony Optimization (H-ACO) framework designed to revolutionize the way vast power transmission and distribution networks are inspected. By leveraging cooperative Operating Vehicle (OV) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems, this framework automates the process of generating optimal, efficient, and safe inspection routes, addressing the inherent limitations of traditional manual methods.

The Problem
Conventional powerline inspection is often characterized by high costs, significant safety risks to personnel, and time-consuming operations, leading to potential delays in fault detection and compromised grid reliability. While UAVs offer a promising alternative, their limited battery life and range necessitate a collaborative approach with ground-based OVs acting as mobile depots. The challenge lies in optimally coordinating these heterogeneous agents across complex, large-scale powerline networks to minimize total operational cost while ensuring comprehensive inspection coverage.

Solution: The H-ACO Framework
Our solution employs a two-tiered H-ACO approach to decompose this complex routing problem:

Outer ACO (OV Routing): This layer focuses on the strategic, inter-cluster movement of the Operating Vehicle. It determines the most efficient tour for the OV to visit geographical clusters of inspection points, acting as mobile bases for UAV deployment and retrieval.

Inner ACOs (UAV Routing): For each cluster visited by the OV, a dedicated Inner ACO plans the detailed, intra-cluster inspection paths for the UAV fleet. These UAVs meticulously cover all assigned powerline nodes and segments within the cluster, adhering to their individual flight range constraints.

This hierarchical structure allows for efficient management of computational complexity, enabling the generation of practical and coherent multi-agent inspection plans.

Key Features & Capabilities
Optimal Route Generation: Minimizes the combined travel distance of OVs and UAVs.

Comprehensive Coverage: Ensures all designated powerline nodes and segments are inspected.

Heterogeneous Agent Coordination: Effectively plans routes for both ground-based OVs and aerial UAVs.

Network-Constrained Pathfinding: UAV paths adhere to actual powerline infrastructure, not just direct "as-the-crow-flies" routes.

Scalability: Designed to handle large-scale powerline networks.

Robustness: Consistently generates high-quality, reproducible solutions.

Experimental Validation
The H-ACO framework was rigorously validated on two distinct datasets:

Synthetic Low Voltage (LV) Powerline Dataset:

Purpose: Confirmed fundamental algorithm functionality, rapid convergence, and stable performance.

Key Outcome: Achieved 100% node coverage and 94% edge coverage, demonstrating comprehensive inspection capabilities in a controlled environment.

Real-World High Voltage (HV) Network (Ghana Electricity Transmission Network):

Purpose: Validated practical applicability in complex, real-world topologies.

Key Outcome: Exhibited consistent and stable convergence, high solution robustness (reproducible near-optimal solutions), and generated actionable, geographically logical OV and UAV routes. Preliminary scalability analysis indicated suitability for large-scale deployments.

Getting Started (Conceptual)
This project is implemented in Python, leveraging libraries for geospatial data processing (e.g., GeoPandas), network analysis (e.g., NetworkX for shortest paths), and clustering (e.g., scikit-learn for K-Means).

To conceptually run the H-ACO framework, you would typically:

Prepare your powerline network data (nodes and edges with coordinates and distances).

Define your OV and UAV parameters (e.g., number of UAVs, UAV range, ACO parameters).

Execute the H-ACO algorithm, which performs clustering, outer ACO for OV routing, and inner ACOs for UAV routing.

Visualize the generated optimal paths and analyze performance metrics.

(Note: This README provides a conceptual overview. Actual runnable code is not included here.)
