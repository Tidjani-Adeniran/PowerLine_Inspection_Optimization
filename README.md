# PowerLine_Inspection_Optimization
This project uses Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to plan efficient UAV paths for inspecting power line corridors. It aims to minimize flight distance, avoid obstacles, and ensure full coverage. ACO simulates ant behavior to find optimal routes, improving safety, speed, and cost-effectiveness of inspections.
